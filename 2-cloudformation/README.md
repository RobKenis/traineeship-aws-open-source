# CloudFormation

CloudFormation is the AWS solution to do infrastructure as code. Instead of manually configuring resources, 
you can define these in YAML or JSON format and apply these configurations in the **CloudFormation** console.

The configuration template for the EC2 instance we just set up, can be found in [ec2.yaml](ec2.yaml).
