# Getting started with AWS

## Logging in
Axxes accounts are managed through Active Directory. In the top left corner in outlook, there should
be a button with **AWS SSO**.
A menu should show up with all available accounts, pick **traineeship-2022**
https://axxes.awsapps.com/start#/

## Picking a region
In the top right corner in the AWS console, there's a dropdown with available regions.
For this session, we will use **eu-west-1**.

## Service overview
In the top left corner, open **services** to get a look at all available services in AWS.

## AWS CLI
Official docs [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html), but *awscli*
should be in the apt repos.
